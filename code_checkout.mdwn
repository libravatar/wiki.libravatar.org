The main repository is using bzr, but that doesn't mean you have to use it since we provide mirrors of the repository in other version control systems.

# Using [bzr](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)

You can [browse the repository](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/trunk/files) or create a local branch for yourself:

    bzr branch lp:libravatar

# Using [git](http://www.git-scm.com)

You can [browse the code](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/trees) on Gitorious and [clone the repository](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/clone).

Otherwise, just check the code out locally:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar.git

# Using other version control systems

Is your favourite source control system not in our list? Well, if you can [[send us|talk to us]] instructions on how to convert a bzr repository to a *YourFavoriteVCS* repository, then we'll try to add it to the sync cronjob we have.
