The main repository is using **git**, but that doesn't mean you have to use it since we provide mirrors of the repository in other version control systems.

# Using [git](http://www.git-scm.com)

You can [browse the code](https://git.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar) on Launchpad or check the code out locally:

    git clone https://git.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar

A mirror of it is also available on [Github](https://github.com/libravatar/libravatar).

# Using [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)

You can [browse the code](https://bitbucket.org/libravatar/libravatar/src) on Bitbucket and [fork the repository](https://bitbucket.org/libravatar/libravatar/fork).

Otherwise, just clone the repo:

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/libravatar/libravatar

# Using other version control systems

Is your favourite source control system not in our list? Well, if you can [[send us|talk to us]] instructions on how to convert a git repository to a *YourFavoriteVCS* repository, then we'll try to add it to the sync cronjob we have.
