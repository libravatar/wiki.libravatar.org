## New 'ivatar' implementation (starting with the first quarter of 2019)

The new VM is hosted on Fedora Infrastructure.

The list of people (Fedora accounts) with root access to the VM can be found here (see `root_auth_users`):

* [production instance](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/inventory/host_vars/libravatar.fedorainfracloud.org)
* [staging instance](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/inventory/host_vars/libravatar-stg.fedorainfracloud.org)

Members of the [Fedora group *sysadmin-libravatar*](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/sysadmin-libravatar) (e.g. Clime) and the global Fedora admins can add more root account users.
