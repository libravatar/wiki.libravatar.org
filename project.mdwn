# libravatar.org project

The *libravatar.org project* is the group of people involved with developing the software and maintaining the service currently known as "libravatar". This entity does not have a legal status. We are just a group of people. We use a [[mailinglist and an IRC channel|talk_to_us]] for discussions and decisions.
