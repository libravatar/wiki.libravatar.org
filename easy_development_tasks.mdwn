There are two places where we keep track of things to do in the project:

* [Bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar): for bugs and suggested features in the code
* [TODO file](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/trunk/view/head:/TODO): for project-wide or sysadmin tasks

But if you are looking for an easy bug / feature to start with, you may want to:

* Fix a [bite-sized bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+bugs?field.tag=bite-sized)
* Implement a new [photo importer](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+bugs?field.tag=photoimporter)

Of course, you can always [[talk to us]] if you have a better idea or need some guidance.
