Here is a place where people who are interested in [taking over Libravatar](https://blog.libravatar.org/posts/Libravatar.org_is_shutting_down_on_2018-09-01/) can coordinate.

Please leave some contact details so that others can reach out to you.

Can we get some statistics about the service now? Both in terms of the infrastructure (assuming infra support won't continue) and in terms of what is required to keep it going?  Do we know how many avatars are served? stored? etc? (bex@pobox.com)

I second this.  I would like to see this service keep going if possible.  How many servers are currently in production and what is the monthly cost to host them?  I have over 15 years experience as a server admin including time in the hosting industry and would love to contribute.  Email is wattersm@watters.ws 

[Proxience](http://proxience.com) and I, [Frédéric Lehobey](https://wiki.debian.org/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ricLehobey), are willing in helping keeping Libravatar running. Email contact is contact@proxience.com.

I also would like to keep the service alive. I can offer hosting. I'm currently trying to deploy a private instance of the project using docker. libravatar@kumy.net

I can offer free hosting for the service. smurf@debian.org

# External accounts

In addition to the domain names (libravatar.org and libravatar.com), the following accounts could be transferred to the new team:

- [Blog](https://blog.libravatar.org) and [wiki](https://wiki.libravatar.org) (hosted for free by [Branchable](https://branchable.com))
- [Launchhpad project](https://launchpad.net/libravatar) (bug tracker, git repo, translations)
- [GitHub project](https://github.com/libravatar) (read-only git mirror of the repos)
- [BitBucket project](https://bitbucket.org/libravatar/) (read-only mercurial mirror of the repo)
- [Transifex account](https://www.transifex.com/fmarier/libravatar/) (mostly unused alternative service for translations)
- [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/libravatar)
- [Identi.ca account](https://identi.ca/libravatar)

Basically I'm willing to help to keep this service up & running and would like to contribute a VM or some disk space and bandwidth by running a mirror. No Django experience though, but slightly able to read Python, but no programmer at all. 
Contact me at ij@2017.bluespice.org or @ingoj on Twitter.

# Digital Ocean

[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) would be a good place to move this service.  A couple of [$10 droplets](https://blog.digitalocean.com/new-droplet-plans) could easily handle the load.  The question is who would you want to own the servers?

The email to reach out for potential DO open source sponsorship is opensource@digitalocean.com

They offered $200 to host two droplets for one year.

DO also ( I believe ) will contribute resources to open source projects that request it.

Has anyone formulated a plan at all to update Libravatar to Python 3 and migrate away from unsupported libraries?

I have setup a new repo here: <https://pagure.io/libravatar2> to modernize/rewrite libravatar to use the latest available tooling. Please concact me if you would like to help.

I am here to help anyway I can, refactoring code, hosting. Please reach out sadin@fedoraproject.org

I published today a server-side implementation in C I started three years ago, available here: <https://github.com/Aversiste/libravatar.cgi>.
It is a CGI program currently implementing the size, default and forcedefault flags with allowed default values of '404', 'mm' and 'blank'.

This is not finished and not a suitable replacement for the current stack as it uses the file system directly but it is good enough for self-hosting. I use it at https://avatars.bouledef.eu/index

I am available for any discussions related to the shutdown and the migration though - tleguern@bouledef.eu

I want to keep this great project alive.I'm the developer of the Mastodon client Halcyon which I took over when the original developer quit his work and deleted his repository.I successfully made it popular again and added many new functions so far.I hope that I can archieve this goal a second time with Libravatar.I don't know the server side languages used here (I'm an PHP developer) but I can modernize the client side and with the support of a great community who will hopefully pay for the servers I can also manage the hosting.I want to keep things open and I think it's bad when everyone has to change to the closed source Gravatar.Instead I want to keep an open source avatar hoster which hopefully will some time in the future federated.I'm always here to help - Email: ni.pos@yandex.com Jabber: bw5rws@jabber.lima-city.de Matrix: @nipos:avareborn.de And I'm also in the #libravatar IRC Channel which could be helpful for coordinating the future of this project.
