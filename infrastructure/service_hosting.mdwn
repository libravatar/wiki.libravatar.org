# Hosting of the libravatar service instance

The instance *libravatar.org* is providing the [[open specification|api]] called *libravatar*. It is run by the [[libravatar project|project]].

## Original implementation (up to the first quarter of 2019)

The VM running the service is currently hosted by [Ingo Juergensmann](https://www.windfluechter.net/).

*fmarier* has root access to the VM.


## New 'ivatar' implementation (starting with the first quarter of 2019)

The new VM is hosted on Fedora Infrastructure.

The list of people (Fedora accounts) with root access to the VM can be found here:

* [production instance](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/inventory/host_vars/libravatar.fedorainfracloud.org)
* [staging instance](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/inventory/host_vars/libravatar-stg.fedorainfracloud.org)

Members of the [Fedora group *sysadmin-libravatar*](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/sysadmin-libravatar) (e.g. Clime) and the global Fedora admins can add more root account users.
