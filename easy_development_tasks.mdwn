**Obsolete: this page refers to the pre-2019 Libravatar service.**

There are two places where we keep track of things to do in the project:

* [Bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar): for bugs and suggested features in the code
* [TODO file](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/master/view/head:/TODO.md): for project-wide or sysadmin tasks

But if you are looking for an easy bug / feature to start with, you may want to:

* Fix a [bite-sized bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+bugs?field.tag=bite-sized)
* Implement a new [photo importer](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+bugs?field.tag=photoimporter)

Of course, you can always [[talk to us]] if you have a better idea or need some guidance.
