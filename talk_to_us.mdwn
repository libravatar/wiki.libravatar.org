There are a few ways to get in touch with the Libravatar developers:

# IRC

If you have an IRC client already, you can join [#libravatar](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23libravatar) on chat.freenode.net.

Otherwise, you can use this [simple web interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=libravatar).

Please keep in mind that you may live in a different timezone than most of the developers. So if you don't get a response, it's not because we're ignoring you, it's probably because we're sleeping :)

# Bug tracker

If you have a question about a particular bug, or some feedback on it, the best thing to do is to comment on that bug itself.

We use [Gitlab](https://git.linux-kernel.at/oliver/ivatar/issues) as our bug tracker.

# Mailing list

If you've got a proposal to discuss or prefer to write to us, you can join [our developers mailing list](https://launchpad.net/~libravatar-fans#mailing-lists).

# Micro-blogging

Finally, you can also put short notices to our attention on [Identica](http://identi.ca/libravatar), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/libravatar) or [Mastodon](https://photog.social/@libravatar).

# Email

And if you need to email us: [dev@libravatar.org](mailto:dev@libravatar.org)
