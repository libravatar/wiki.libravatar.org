Here is the current list of steps required to add a new po-based translation to the Libravatar codebase:

1. get the po file from the [Launchpad repo](https://code.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/libravatar-po)
2. add the po file under [po/libravatar](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/trees/master/po/libravatar)
3. create a new directory under [libravatar/locale/](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/trees/master/libravatar/locale) add the appropriate symlink pointing to the above po file
4. add the language to the <tt>LANGUAGES</tt> array in [libravatar/settings.py.example](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/blobs/master/libravatar/settings.py.example) and the local <tt>settings.py</tt>
5. add the language code to the for loop in the <tt>pofiles</tt> target of the [Makefile](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/blobs/master/Makefile)
6. run the <tt>make pofiles</tt> command and commit changes to the <tt>en</tt> translation (i.e. the POT file)
