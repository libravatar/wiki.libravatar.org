Libravatar was designed so that domain owners can choose to host themselves the profile pictures for their domain. For example, an organisation may want to have control over the pictures use for their employees.

# System requirements

You can find the latest system requirements in the [installation instructions](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/trunk/view/head:/INSTALL) that come with the software, but Libravatar has been confirmed to work on [Debian 6](http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/) (squeeze).

# Getting the code

We are not currently doing regular releases of the code, but you can easily get the latest copy from our [Bazaar repository](https://code.launchpad.net/libravatar):

    bzr branch lp:libravatar

# Installation

Once you've got a copy of the code, follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/trunk/view/head:/INSTALL) file.

# Configuration

A number of options can be customised in the libravatar/settings.py file. If there's anything that's unclear in there, please [file a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+filebug) against the project so that we know how to improve the documentation.

# DNS setup

Once your instance is running on a publicly-accessible server (<tt>avatars.example.com</tt> in this example), add the following records to your DNS zone file:

    _avatars._tcp.example.com.     IN SRV 0 0 80  avatars.example.com
    _avatars-sec._tcp.example.com. IN SRV 0 0 443 avatars.example.com

The first entry (<tt>\_avatars.\_tcp</tt>) should point to an HTTP server whereas the second one (<tt>\_avatars-sec.\_tcp</tt>) is for an HTTPS server (if you have one).

Note that these servers do not have to be running [Libravatar](https://launchpad.net/libravatar) themselves, but they do have to implement the same [[protocol/API|API]]</a>.

## TTL

The time-to-live (cache expiry) should be set to **at least 1 day** (86400 seconds).

If you choose a TTL smaller than 1 day, Libravatar clients are allowed (and encouraged) to ignore it and cache your entry for a day.

## Subdomains

If you use full hostnames or subdomains in your email addresses, for example bob@foo.example.com and bob@bar.example.com, then you need to have a set of SRV records for each of them:

    _avatars._tcp.foo.example.com.     IN SRV 0 0 80  avatars.example.com
    _avatars-sec._tcp.foo.example.com. IN SRV 0 0 443 avatars.example.com
    _avatars._tcp.bar.example.com.     IN SRV 0 0 80  avatars.example.com
    _avatars-sec._tcp.bar.example.com. IN SRV 0 0 443 avatars.example.com

## SRV weights and priorities (optional)

All SRV entries should have the same priority. Lower priority ones will be ignored by Libravatar clients.

You may however use weights to spread the load across more than one avatar server.

## Testing

Once you have these records, have a look at the [domain check tool](http://www.libravatar.org/tools/check_domain) to make sure eveprything is working.
