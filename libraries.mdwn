If a library or plugin is not availble for your language or application, your best option at the moment is to use our [[simple API|API]]. Don't worry though, it's really not that much work!

# Libraries

## Perl

The [Libravatar::URL](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gravatar-URL/lib/Libravatar/URL.pm) module is part of the [Gravatar::URL](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gravatar-URL/) package (<tt>libgravatar-url-perl</tt> in [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libgravatar-url-perl) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgravatar-url-perl)) since version 1.03.

    use Libravatar::URL;
    my $avatar_url = libravatar_url(email => 'person@example.org');
    print '<img src="' . $avatar_url . '">';

As of version 1.04, you can also use OpenID URLs instead of email addresses:

    my $avatar_url = libravatar_url(openid => 'https://example.com/id/person');

## Ruby

[Kang-min Liu](http://gugod.org) has created a [Libravatar Ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/libravatar).

    require 'libravatar'
    avatar_url = Libravatar.new(:email => 'person@example.org')
    print '<img src="', avatar_url, '">'

You can also use <tt>:openid => 'https://example.com/id/person'</tt> instead of providing an email address.
