Depending on your interest and what programming languages you know, there are a few options to [[contribute]] to Libravatar:

# Plugins / Libraries

We want to see the Libravatar community grow and one of the best ways to do this is to expand the range of applications supporting [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org) out of the box, or with the help of a plugin/extension.

Please consider writing a patch, plugin or extension for your favourite web applications. There might already be a [[library|libraries]] for the relevant programming language. Otherwise, you could always write one!

# Core Application

And of course, there is plenty of work to be done on the [main application](https://launchpad.net/libravatar). If you are a developer who wants to make a difference and work on a real Open Source project, we want to [[hear from you|talk to us]]!
