There are many ways to contribute to Libravatar. Make sure you come and [[talk to us]]!

Here are just a few ideas:

# Theming

Are you a CSS / graphics guru? Do you have any ideas on how to improve the style of our [website](http://www.libravatar.org)?

We would be delighted to have you on board!

# Translating

You can now make Libravatar speak your language through an [easy web interface](https://translations.launchpad.net/libravatar/trunk). No coding required!

# Developing plug-ins

We want to see the Libravatar community grow and one of the best ways to do this is to expand the range of applications supporting Libravatar. Please consider writing a [[plug-in or extension|suggested plugins]] for your favourite web applications. There might already be a [[library|Libraries]] for the relevant programming language. Otherwise, you could write one!

# Hosting a [[mirror|run a mirror]]

Given that Libravatar is a community project without a big corporate sponsor, we need help serving images. If you can spare a bit of disk space and bandwidth, please [get in touch](mailto:mirrors@libravatar.org), we would love your help in building a world-wide mirror network.

# Programming

And of course, there is plenty of work to be done on the main application. If you are a developer who wants to make a difference and work on a real Open Source project, we want to hear from you!

Start by setting up your [[development environment]] and then [grab a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar) or start implementing an idea you have.
