Libravatar's images are automatically served by a network of mirrors (through [DNS round-robin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS)). To get the latest list of mirrors on a UNIX machine, run:

    dig cdn.libravatar.org

for HTTP IPv4 mirrors and:

    dig AAAA seccdn.libravatar.org

for HTTPS IPv6 mirrors.

# Become a mirror

If you have a server with some spare disk space and bandwidth, please consider supporting the project by running a mirror.

At the moment, it consists of installing a Debian package which takes care of setting up Apache and receives regular updates via rsync.

Please contact [[mirrors@libravatar.org]] for details.
