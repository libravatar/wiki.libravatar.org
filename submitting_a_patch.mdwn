The preferred way to submit a patch is via Launchpad merge requests.

# Launchpad merge requests

Once you have a [Launchpad account](https://launchpad.net/+login), here's how to clone the main repository and then push a personal branch to Launchpad:

    git clone https://git.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar
    cd libravatar
    git remote add francois git+ssh://git.launchpad.net/~fmarier/libravatar
    git checkout -b test
    (commit some changes)
    git push -u francois test

(In this example, my username is `fmarier`, my branch name is `test` and the git remote for my personal repo is `francois`.)

Once you have done that, your repository will be shown in the list of [libravatar repositories](https://code.launchpad.net/libravatar) and clicking on it will take you to the [list of branches it contains](https://code.launchpad.net/~fmarier/libravatar/+git/libravatar).

To submit a merge request, click on the [branch name](https://code.launchpad.net/~fmarier/libravatar/+git/libravatar/+ref/test) and then click the ["Propose for merging"](https://code.launchpad.net/~fmarier/libravatar/+git/libravatar/+ref/test/+register-merge) button.

Enter the following information:

- Target repository: `~libravatar/libravatar/+git/libravatar`
- Target branch: `master`

before clicking "Propose merge". This will take you to your newly-created [merge request](https://code.launchpad.net/~fmarier/libravatar/+git/libravatar/+merge/345611).

# Other ways to submit a patch

If the above doesn't work for you, here are other ways to contribute your patch:

1. Attach it to the relevant bug on the [tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar) (create a [new bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+filebug) if you need to)
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on [Github](https://github.com/libravatar/libravatar)
