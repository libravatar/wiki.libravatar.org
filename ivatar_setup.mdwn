If you would like to setup libravatar in a cloud or just for development, please, take a look [here](https://git.linux-kernel.at/oliver/ivatar/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

If you intend a non-cloud/self-made deployment that uses a webserver, please, take a look at [ansible playbooks](https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/libravatar)
that describe deployment of the www.libravatar.org instance. These playbooks are not standalone - you can't use them to deploy libravatar on a target machine from scratch - but they should give you
a good starting point for your own deployment.

If you actually decide to write a _standalone_ ansible role for your deployment that potentially anyone can use, please, contact us and we will try to sync content of our playbooks with yours. Documented
libravatar role that anyone can use would be of a great value.

Good luck and at any time, contact us at #libravatar Freenode channel or at libravatar-fans@lists.launchpad.net mailing list for any kind of help or discussion. We will be very happy to work with
you to setup your own instance.
