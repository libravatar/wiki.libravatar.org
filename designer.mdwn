Are you a CSS / graphics guru? Do you have any ideas on how to improve the style of our [website](https://www.libravatar.org)?

We would be delighted to have you on board!

The best place to start is to [[talk to us]] and then:

1. grab a copy of the [HTML templates](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/trees/master/libravatar/templates) and [CSS files](https://gitorious.org/libravatar/libravatar/trees/master/static/css)
2. make them look fresh and attractive (i.e. the hard creative bit)
3. attach them to a [new bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+filebug)
